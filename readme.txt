== Description ==

This Plugin provides a [Space Api](http://spaceapi.net) Json file. This plugin is right now pretty much a proof of concept. It doesnt validate anything and is far from being a nice and maintainable source. It should work however.

With Permalinks enabled, you can access the file with http://yourdomain.tld/spaceapi.json, otherwise http://yourdomain.tld/?spaceapi=show

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or by upload in the webinterface.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set up the correct settings in the admin interface
